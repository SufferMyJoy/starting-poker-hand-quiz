#Starting Poker Hand Quiz

This is a basic page that will quiz you on what action you should take with a poker starting hand. You should either Fold, Call or Raise depending on what cards you have. The page will keep track of how many you've answered correctly out of all the hands you've seen. The calculations are made based on the [Chen Formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em_starting_hands#Chen_formula).
